so not not that much uh what did you do I come here and put myself in front of you for fun this is fun what did you do to uh what did you do to to where you needed to get sobriety how did you know that you would hit bottom ooh Slow Burn uh I think being an alcoholic at 15 was probably the first L holy [ __ ] how long what made you start at 15 uh I'm from Florida I feel maybe I should have done that material you guys would have connected more with it do you remember what your first drink was ooh mine was a Lynchberg lemonade made by Jack Daniels it was pre-bottled uh alcohol and my older brothers let me have one when we were frisbee golfing in Columbus Ohio I think I was 13 or 14 maybe 12 and uh yeah I liked the way that it made me feel yeah we should we shouldn't all just celebrate our first drink but I remember my first Dr it was great it was a vodka Cruiser do you have those here no what is that it's like vodka and pink lemonade it's very girly drink yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't know I girly drinks are how the party starts red bam what was yours a bowl of mashed potatoes Old Milwaukee Old Milwaukee wow in chili oh my God I think I was vodka with like orange juice Chaser I think was what it was the champ well we well done on sobriety thanks you're welcome I would never do it yeah but I think it's good yeah you know how about towards the end do you get into anything crazy do you do drugs or anything oh yeah um well again I'm from Florida so there's a lot of cocaine in Florida uh lots of it um I got a couple of DUIs over the years there was there was some stuff that was not uh ideal he loves it de Madness loves a good DUI they pull him over every time he tries to drive 100 sir you're swerving all over uh do you have any old photos that you're trying to get

what else would we find interesting about you um well you hate art so uh I'm not sure you're going to find anything about that that interesting okay what else other than the art podcast what do I do other than the art podcast I work out a lot um I like pit bulls I'm a dog person yeah what do you like about pitbulls uh they're like a you know I like pites cuz they're like I like men just like a violent liability yeah does that does that make sense I like a dog that's like dangerous it's great yeah well you picked the right one James M what is the overlap in the fite World between that and I think of that as a golden retriever provision I think of pit bulls as more of like Cadillacs bouncing up and down and yeah no is that not right yeah sure but they're a good dog you know no no I think they kill children every year are they legal in Australia no killed so many I think they're big parts of the world you can't get that dog but you like that it's dangerous you have a six thing for the dog no no I have a girl I have a girl dog to be clear I have a girl dog you can meet her she's very nice it's a piple yeah okay and can it be around other dogs not really no right yeah great what a great animal to have something you can take outside and scare everybody to death with I do have a cat and it's very good with the cat so there's that okay has your cat been crawling up on Martin Phillips's porch at all do we know about this do you have a tracker on it your cat might be sleeping at a tremendously weak gripped man's porch um anyway yeah I uh yeah I don't know I love it well Jenna congratulations you made your kill Tony debut there she go I'm going to throw you a little joke book oh it was so close I don't know where it went so close right into the I think you were aiming

ladies and gentlemen your next comedian goes by the name of Mike Poe Mike Poe here is Mike po everybody makes some noise for Mike everyone so in addition to struggling to be a standup comic I'm also a hack party DJ uh but that's a lot easier than doing this because being a DJ today all I'm really concerned about is touching buttons and looking concerned holding my ear and pointing maybe somebody in the audience you would hope were connecting with you uh that's a lot more difficult to do as a standup comic obviously um so in addition to being a DJ I also volunteer for the unsheltered and that's where I get most of the funny stories that uh I talk about like the uh guy who stole my entire bag from me who I had to track down on the street and explained to me that unfortunately uh he's on drugs

what else like are you into you have a are you have you have like a vinyl record player right of course I I yeah I've been playing records since 1989 yep exactly what else is hip about you you have like a [ __ ] unicycle or something like that what's what's your weird form of transportation I can tell you have one like an electric scooter or something so I I have a news van that I'm selling when I get home because I need to pay for my police van to get repaired pedophile pedophile I'm trading a van for a van that another van they're com catching under my van I figure if I get a police van no

been single for a while yeah nine years you ever been married no have you what's the longest relationship you've ever been in four years four years longest ever 52 why do you think that is uh man just a lot of curveballs in life it it happens what kind of curve balls can you can you explain some of the curveballs that you've had in your life all right I'm just curious you're in the I'm a federal witness okay what does that mean yeah yeah are you on witness protection I'm not protected okay at all why are you on the bigest I'm hiding either I wouldn't tell you my name okay that's all good can you just tell us the ballpark of what you're a federal witness about this seems like a very compelling part of this interview and I appreciate your open honesty sure um people are going to find this I'm a Survivor or a a federal witness to homicide my adult adopted autistic brother was murdered a decade ago adult autistic adult adopted like we adopted him as an adult cuz he didn't have a family adopted and he was on on the street adult autistic Y and he was [Music] on he would he would love this he would absolutely love he would love it most of our fan base is adopted uh autistic people adopted it uh wow how old was he when you guys adopted him uh so he was probably 30 years old or so 30 years old and your parents were like come on in yep well my my uh my my mom and my sisters yeah you called them his mom and his where did they find this guy at uh he worked with me at the bar I managed and uh one night he didn't show up and I found out he was in jail and I bailed him out and found him a place to live and got him on disab was he in jail for at the time uh he in in Arkansas we don't have any renters rights he was evicted and he he didn't check his mail so he got arrested for being evicted right like forcibly removed so then he got murdered yeah he was he was murdered in 2014 December 7th 2014 okay tell us about that what happened there uh there was a uh the only suspect we'll say uh is a crack Pusher uh and uh this suspect's name is Andre Demetrius smly junor you didn't have to you didn't have to say that part you didn't have to call them out by name what's happening in this show can't buy me but this killer yeah in my opinion uh he was he was pushing crack on him at gunpoint and um he wouldn't stop he wouldn't leave him alone and uh he just kept breaking in the door stealing his phone and his keys and extorting us until uh finally got a warrant he got arrested and then he bailed out and murdered him so there would be no case wow absolutely incredible and did he not get in trouble for that uh well not for a while but then I became a federal witness after he shot two more people because they wouldn't go to court so I called every agency possible and I landed on the ATF and this lady uh said if I signed an affidavit and I promised to go to court that because I was involved in a previous crime of his in a federal court uh I can get some Justice by compelling the judge to hear my story about this person before he sentences him this is a great anecdote but you might be on the wrong podcast I I mean there are I don't think so there are quite a lot of True Crime podcasts out there where this would be A+ level this is content perfect I love it on this podcast I don't know how you get a laugh out of the crack Pusher who Mur I was just really hoping that the minute that I did before this was better it wasn't uh uh no this is this is amazing I had no idea I was getting C the minute crazy it's okay that's what happens but this is how it happens this is part of the magic of the show is the interview sometimes is better than the minute if it was just about people's minutes that I wouldn't even do this part of the show this is the fun part is watching people go through the quick dilemma am I going to answer this how far am I going to go for a second you're a federal witness we don't know anything the next you're going Andre Demetrius Johnson II located at 452 [ __ ] Jenkins Street Bing s he really exploded there here he is and here he is ladies and gentlemen the guy that this is the man that murdered his brother everybody this is Demetrius Andre Gallagher III everybody AKA D Madness he's out on bail there you go uh so this gu's in prison now for life no we just we just got him nine years for that uh so he was just recently released and I I went to San Francisco and then I came here okay hold on hold on you're telling when did he get out of prison uh last month no December 21st uh okay and this guy knows for a fact that you're the one that put him in prison right oh yeah yeah he was in shackles when his wrists and ankles screaming my name as the bayi pulled him out of the courtroom oh my God and he just got out in December yeah absolutely do you know where he is do you know where he resides es he lived in Little Rock before right his his his parole probation officer called me he said I can't really have that information but I I kind of know a little bit you might have a little bit of an idea and is it around where you kind of live um I mean it it's it's probably better for me to to to not look for him too much well I'm not saying you should look for him I'm wondering if he looking for you yes uh I mean if I'm being real honest I think the gu probably been in prison for 9 years he's a six-time felon uh he he's going to create chaos wherever he goes I don't think he's looking for me uh specifically like on the streets looking for me this is very optimistic but you see that I'm not in my city right as well like I don't want to run into him at a Kroger or at a stoplight or uh you know uh uh NA meeting or where you know wherever you know you go to NA meetings no I was just making some [ __ ] up but okay but uh I don't want to run into him anywhere right honestly you know like that's that's not somebody I want to see so I just decided to move you decided to move from Little Rock yeah right and okay wow that's all so interesting but you just called him out on a podcast that is aired out everywhere sure did I called him out in court too yeah there you go well we've got to get him on the show for a right out reply and here he is is uh Mike here's a little joke book just don't tell my mom okay she might find out it's all good you're good this is a very popular shot do

was at Subway I was at McDonald's I was at some ones you don't have over here like what Billy backers Cafe it was run by Chinese people and they wanted me to be the face of it cuz they thought it was weird for Chinese people to have a cafe and uh it were just like six old ladies who would sit in the middle and frown at me they owned it they would just sit and frown at the fat white boy who can't be charismatic enough were they who's live for now Billy Baxter's Cafe that's they went out of business um and that was in Australia sweet adelay Australia but I think I believe in I think you're a charismatic man and you I think you can do better than a smoke shop I think you'll go further than that thank you man appreciate that also I find the smoke shop weird and disturbing I don't like them they're a little unsettling they're [ __ ] in Vans all over the street pedling marijuana to young people have you I thought it was illegal in Texas and they're standing on the street trying to get people high that's a pusher next thing you know they'll be murdering some guys ortis IC brother I like the set I appreciate you man you're welcome you were the first act in a long time that I wasn't

closed down it was in Adelaide arcade why have they still got one there well we happen to read a Yelp review from Billy Baxter's Cafe the food is consistently good the breakfasts are terrific but oh my goodness the coffee is bad Jesus two stars it's weak gray soapy and unpalatable a double shot results in brown coffee but bitter to the point of being undrinkable does the machine need a good cleanout does the staff need lessons in temperature control a weird chubby redheaded man in a beard greeted us which is strange because it seemed to be owned by Asian women who angrily stared at him from the front windows two stars after all the beautiful hosting work I was doing you do it you stitched me up you have you have to you have to admire how long it takes Red Band to type words properly I said Billy back Cafe Yelp I look over he goes there is nothing and I look and it's he typed in Billy Bass literally just B SS so we had a whole thing here it's really Stu and then he spelled backer o at the end there's a lot that goes on it is a thankless job hosting this constantly sinking ship I having great fun I know the band plays while the ship sinks it's the Titanic all right you [ __ ]

you're [Music] right that's it all right Anthony Ruan have you been on this show before I have not Tony okay well welcome welcome how long you been doing standup uh I've been doing standup for a year

on a show right now thank you guys there you go absolutely um what do you do for a living uh I'm a cake decorator okay there you go absolutely that's amazing how long have you been decorating cakes for uh for about a year and a half about as long as I've been doing standup amazing and you decided to both start stand-up comedy and decorating cakes at the same time what were you doing before that uh I was driving semi trucks James well how sorry how do you go from you seem pretty young to have had a midlife crisis inste I'm going into cake decoration I'm so happy you have an interesting job that we can talk about in the show yes much better than what cakes do you like to decorate wedding cakes kids birthday cakes do you do it at HGB or a fancy place I'm fascinated tell us all about the cake decorating I am so interested it's uh Walmart you got to start somewhere wow how did how does this start how does one even get into cake decorating uh it's the highest what one of the highest paid positions at Walmart so you went to a Walmart you're like what kind of jobs are available you looked at the pay and you're like I'll just take on cake decorating it's exactly that wow incredible were you driving trucks for Walmart before that uh no I was driving for a beer company okay what made you want to stop driving and start cake decorating uh a DUI ah yes that'll do it a many of your favorite cake decorators were once truck drivers wow amazing amazing where were you when you got the DUI were you getting high on your own Supply out of the back of the truck no I was uh driving home from a a new faces com show at 10 p.m impr uhhuh and uh I got pulled over while I was eating McDonald's is that a crime if that's a crime I inan big [ __ ] if that's a crime then red bands Jack the Ripper H okay so I I got pulled over when I saw the lights I panicked and I dropped the McDonald's all over myself oh yeah uh and then my thought process was like if the cop sees this McDonald's all over me in my car he's going to like assume I'm drunk and you were a little drunk right yeah I hid I hid the McDonald's in my pockets oh I love this now we're [ __ ] talking finally a moment of an interview where somebody admits [ __ ] something yeah other than them being a federal witness against Demetrius Andre Jenkins thei not this guy uh-uh not you not you so you're shoving like what what are we talking about fries burgers are there sauces in your pockets like what do you remember McDoubles whoa oh my God so is this is while you're pulling over is or as as he's approaching no I had them all in the pockets by the time I was pulled over he didn't find them until he searched me oh my god oh my god wow this is incredible so you're driving you're eating McDonald's you got McDoubles no fries you win straight no yeah there's if you use the app you get a free uh I did not know this redband Redban actually created the app not a lot of people know that uh okay so so you see the lights you're eating McDoubles straight up how did you get to eatat some of the McDouble at least like yeah I was like halfway through that first one right and then you took the second one out of the bag in its wrapper and put it in your pocket I kind of had them like all laid out how many how many how many McDoubles did you get when you say all I had I had three I had three McDoubles that is six hamburgers in between three sets of buns ladies and gentlemen that is true that is a m that's a mle I want you to answer this question truthfully are you the [Laughter] Hamburglar honestly that guy is legit as [ __ ] so I would yeah I would take the hamburger true gangster so you take a burger no you take two and a half burgers and you shove them in your pockets and then the cop comes up and what's what's the first moment in which you realize that you might get in trouble does he say that he smells alcohol coming yeah he was like you've been drinking and you're like no yeah right yeah but what had you drank that night let's go through it here uh lots of tequila shots oh yeah I was celebrating a good Set uh at a temp and impr so I uh do it in Tempe Tempe you are loving it right Tempe uses unmarked cars correct was it an unmarked police car uh no it was marked okay it was Chandler Police Department yeah up did you have to go to Maricopa County Court uh no I went to Chandler courts they gave me like mandatory minimums like two days in jail house arrest did they make double your fine [ __ ] yeah D all right that was it was a pretty big F what did he say when he was feeling when he's patting you down and he goes there's a little a little something here you was it like is there anything do you have anything in your pockets that could hurt me or give me heart disease yeah it won't pick or poke you but it'll give you cholesterol there you go yep yeah it uh the he his exact words when he pulled them out is he had them in his hands and he said uh why are there burgers in your pockets people ask red ban that every day and then what did you say I said exact words I said I don't know take me to JW brilliant at least you knew cuz I was going to say you must have skipped the test and everything after that right you admitted to being drunk yeah I did there was no hiding it that makes sense wow so from a high to a load did you have to spend the night there uh no actually they put me in the cell they closed the door and then they opened it and they let me go and I was actually like less than a mile away from my house when I got out of uh when I got out of the the the police department I could see my apartment complex amazing perfect do you talk about this on stage by the way that's way better than anything you said on your minute yeah I do I have I have a bit that's pretty much like just exactly what I said right now it usually works yeah no that makes sense uh wow so what's the craziest thing that's ever happened to you as a cake decorator weirdest cake you ever made uh there's not like really weird cakes I've had like people say they don't like them ah what did they not like your decoration part or the flavor uh honestly I think they like it until they see me and then they like notice that I'm the one that made the cake has there ever been a time where you felt like um you know someone was going to rob you at the Cake store and you started shoving cake in your pockets have you ever gone back to have you ever put more food in your pockets before or since then no that was the first and only time were you stoned were you high did you smoke some weed that night no I was just that was my honest just a night in Tempe a wild night in Tempe a hot night lots of tequila and you're shoving burgers and your I can't imagine being that kind of drunk to where I'd be like [ __ ] I got to get rid of these [ __ ] Burgers Jes if he sees his Burgers he's gonna know I'm drunk like I would eat the burger and I would like try to [ __ ] get a pickle yeah put some like pickles on my neck don't smell alcohol exactly yeah I'd rub the burger I'd put it everywhere but my pockets that's like the exact opposite of what I thought yeah did it feel good yeah would you ever do it again for leisure yes in a heartbeat in a heartbeat I I've often thought about putting a McGriddle down the front of the trouser yeah if it was 2 hours later it would be a different story oh yeah you were foiled by time yeah you couldn't have Hot Cakes in the pants I couldn't Anthony congratulations you got pulled out of the bucket here uh you could put that in your

in Canada which means the government pays me to stick my finger at people's butts yeah go to wear glove though yeah morphine is addictive Western medicine tried to solve this with Heroin oops it was sold over the counter to treat coughs in children but it worked you know it also helped kids learn how to write the a a lowercase n and it's for nap time and is for Nancy didn't wake up from nap time but don't worry morphine's been repl I'm sorry don't worry heroin's been replaced by its non-addictive cousin fentol modern medicine we just keep getting better I'm sorry how old are you I'm 30 even if a guy [ __ ] you he should still be on a list you know that is true my man looking for loopholes it is incredible this is what uh free health care gets you ladies and gentlemen imagine walking in and this is your doctor are you like a General Health Doctor wow yeah I work um I'm a general practitioner I work uh up North so I do like a clinic emergency room and uh in the hospital in a r place is that weird to be a white doctor in Canada I hear it's mostly Chinese there's a lot of white South African doctors interesting yeah they're they're really good why do you think uh the South Africans are so good at being doctors uh it's their training programs yeah they're just intense yeah the the colleges in South Africa yeah I think it's kind of like a trial by fire type of thing so they're just good at handling situations I can't believe you've killed another one you're shameful you would do what that teacher told you to do yeah yep what was your schooling like super Canadian yeah now a lot of people don't know this but I study the Canadian Health Care system because they brag about how good it is and I like to do my own research just to make sure that I live in the greatest country on planet Earth and I do uh I don't know if you guys know this but Canada does suicides now for anybody that wants one am I correct no okay correct me where I'm wrong it's like it's called made which is medical assistance and dying and no one's ever approached me about it but it's like that's because you're working at you just said at an emergency like Urgent Care thing so they would go to a hospital or a normal actual professional actual real money-making full-time doctor I work in a clinic too yeah no I know that's that would they wouldn't go to like a free clinic for that they would just be like hey everything's free everywhere like what you're saying a clinic that's just like the minor league Hospital right uh no yes yeah it is what's the difference between a clinic and a hospital I work in a hospital also what do you do at the hospital uh in patient care is that the people that would kill themselves sometimes yeah I guess so yeah cuz it's like for terminally ill terminal illnesses that cause like a lot of suffering I know 21 people who want to get that yeah yeah I've talked to multiple Canadian doctors and civilians that live in Canada and they have all known someone or know people or have assigned it you haven't I know I know people who have but but I've just never had a patient approach to make this clear so that everybody understands in Canada it's not you're sick with something and dying from something that would make you kill yourself like here in America you have to be dying in order to have other people help you kill yourself in Canada you just have to be sad correct oh no that but that's something they've talked about which would be really [ __ ] up if it's like that became a thing and then like you don't accept um like psychedelic medicines which are really like you know you know what I mean like it sounds like you're in denial that your health care system in Canada is so wild that sad people just get to kill themselves and then they schedule them to kill themselves where's the air horn when you need it yeah I I don't know if that's like in practice yet but that's a dark dystopian potential on hold on you say that it's a dark dystopian potential that it's not in use can you describe what maid is then oh but it's just not for sad people it's like for suffering but for or for like physical pain but do you think you have to have physical pain to do it there I think so you're wrong okay that's possible you could just be sad oh I know more about your system than you cuz I have a bit about it that I'm purposefully not doing because I don't want to leak it here because I want to do it on a thing one day yeah but I would go into it and it works okay yeah but the point is is the premise is what's most important here's what's crazy is not only this is going to be interesting for you not only do Canadians do this over 2,000 actually over between 1500 and 2,000 people did it in 2024 and again this is no physical layment this is just being sad um I wish I was in Canada right now I know that's that was the joke that I implied 28 seconds ago now um perfect timing by the way to do that then but they schedule you so literally it's not like you go into the hospital and you're like I want to kill myself and they're like come on we'll do it they schedule you for a later date they Pro they have to process stuff and do things so they're literally like okay come back on this date and we will help you kill yourself and uh people have to wait and that's Canadian or or you go to their home really yeah service with a smile up there in Canada they do it they go to their home home visit what's the weapon uh it's an injectable drug yeah and you've never done it though no you know in Finland they have the highest rates of suicides in the world and also last year the happiest country in the world suicide Works no doubt about it all right we're going to keep it moving there goes Ashley Palmer ladies and gentlemen thank you Ashley welcome to America we're going to keep it moving here this is bucket pool I don't know again I think it's 21 maybe Owen Gallivan everybody Owen [Music] Gallivan hey everybody cuz I think uh registered sex offenders are like really dumb yeah I'm never going to register That's My Little Secret you guys for real though I don't know how we landed on the term registered sex offenders feels a little soft for what they actually are could have easily went with convicted sex offenders but we went we registered for some reason why are we making it sound like there're sex offenders that did all the proper paperwork like you register to vote you register a weapon you register your car I don't think a cops ever walked up on a sexual assault like license and registration he's like oh [ __ ] that actually checks out my bad didn't realize you had all your ducks in a row sir all right thanks all right I like that one you like that one that was a good one really yeah it was there was like clever stuff I would love to have you on the secret show Thursday yes really thank you am I losing my [ __ ] mind right now he's funny registered sex all right we're
